# Portfolio Return Analysis: Time Series Patterns and Statistical Insights
This project analyzes the time series patterns and statistical properties of portfolio returns for the largest 136 stocks in Australia from **December 1999 to June 2014**. The analysis includes calculations of simple and log returns, portfolio weights, kurtosis, and autocorrelation, providing insights into market behavior and return distributions.

---

## Objective

- Calculate and compare **simple and log returns** for a portfolio of stocks.
- Visualize **portfolio return time series** over the analysis period.
- Analyze **excess kurtosis** of stock returns and portfolio returns.
- Examine **autocorrelation** to identify potential predictability in portfolio returns.

---

## Key Findings

1. **Time Series Visualization**:
   - Simple and log returns exhibit notable fluctuations, especially during market volatility periods (e.g., 2008 financial crisis).

2. **Excess Kurtosis**:
   - Stock returns demonstrate heavy tails and leptokurtosis, suggesting a higher risk of extreme outcomes.
   - Portfolio returns show lower kurtosis compared to individual stocks, indicating diversification benefits.

3. **Autocorrelation Insights**:
   - Portfolio log returns display low autocorrelation, with some lags slightly above statistical significance, indicating weak predictability.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Statsmodels.
- **Metrics**: Simple/log returns, portfolio weights, kurtosis, and ACF/PACF plots.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Portfolio return series (simple and log).
  - Histogram of excess kurtosis.
  - Autocorrelation plots.
